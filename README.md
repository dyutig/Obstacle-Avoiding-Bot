# Obstacle-Avoiding-Bot

This was my 6th semester mini-project as part of my curriculum.
Please refer the ppt for clear understanding of the concept.
Also refer the code which has been run.

Besides, the videos in this repository show the different aspects of this project.
There are 3 videos:
1. Blinking LED: When obstacle is within 15cm and 30cm, LED keeps blinking as warning.
                 When obstacle is less than 15 cm away, LED is fixed on for a duration.
                 When there is no obstacle, LED is off.
2. Obstacle bottles: When if comes accross an obstacle, which is the bottles in this case, it check the space a little on the left, right and accordingly decides its path.
3. Obstacle Wall: When there is a wall in front, and there is no space to go in front, then it turns 180 degrees and goes back its original path.

Thank you for reading.
